    a: "Our listings are updated in real-time. As soon as a property is uploaded or its status changes, it is reflected on our portal immediately."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I book a viewing directly through the website?",
    a: "Yes! You can click the 'Book Viewing' button on any property detail page to send a direct request to the listing agent or landlord."
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any hidden fees for tenants or buyers?",
    a: "No, we believe in 100% transparency. Any applicable fees are clearly stated in the property description. We do not charge hidden search or registration fees."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I filter for specific property types like 'Commercial'?",
    a: "You can use the secondary sector filter at the top of the search page to toggle between Residential and Commercial properties effortlessly."
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if I can't find what I'm looking for?",
    a: "You can save your search or contact our support team. We often have new listings coming soon that aren't public yet."
